<p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong><br><strong>Informal Negotiations</strong><br>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least&nbsp;30&nbsp;days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.<br><br><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong><br>Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) &nbsp;according to the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is considered as the part of this clause.

If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
